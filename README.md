# Prompt Engineering for Dialogue Summarization

Welcome to Prompt Engineering for Dialogue Summarization project! This project explores the effectiveness of prompt engineering techniques in enhancing dialogue summarization tasks using language models.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to showcase how prompt engineering can significantly improve the performance of language models in dialogue summarization tasks. By providing tailored prompts to guide the model's generation process, we aim to achieve more accurate and contextually relevant summaries of dialogues.

## How to Use

To get started, run the check out the full tutorial and explanation in our Medium article:

Moreover, you can directly access the [summarize_dialogue.ipynb](https://github.com/mahmoudBidry/Summarization-Task-Prompt-Engineering-Flan-T5-Base/blob/main/summarize_dialogue.ipynb) file on my GitHub repository to delve into the code. Alternatively, you can open the notebook in Google Colab by clicking [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TrmAE7qNHiywzJKuCqftizsPM4PcKrBp?usp=sharing).

In the Medium article, you'll find a detailed walkthrough of the project, including code implementation, explanation of prompt engineering concepts (zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot), utilization of the "knkarthick/dialogsum" dataset, and application of the FLAN-T5-Base model.
